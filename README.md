# MinecraftDataPacker
A development Environment for Minecraft Data Packs

This is currently a work in progress and still not fit for use.

The aim for this project is to create an IDE for developing Minecraft Data packs to make it more accessable to all users no matter the skill level to be able to modify the game.
